<h1>Google Keep Notes Clone</h1>

I developed a Google Keep Notes clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The project features a clean and responsive user interface for creating, editing, and deleting notes, each displaying a real-time date stamp. 

I incorporated local storage to ensure note persistence even after page refresh. 

A toggle for dark mode enhances user experience, and interactive elements provide a seamless interface.
